# Social-Network-Analysis-of-Libraries
This project scrapes data of around 80 libraries' Instagram accounts and uses NetworkX to model the networks, as well as analyze the different networks formed and centrality measures computed. It ultimately generates a list of the most influential Library Instagram accounts, in order for other Library accounts to follow and become more infleuntial.
